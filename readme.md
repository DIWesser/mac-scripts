This project has moved to [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/diwesser/scripts).

# Todo

- [ ] Is the installer even working?
- [ ] Isn't there a way for the install sript to know where it is located and link the scripts accordingly?
- [ ] Maybe make the desktop files take into account script location.

# Notes

- [Counterpart](https://github.com/jedda/Counterpart)
  - This is a rsync 3 wrapper for OSX
  - There do seem to be some interesting tweaks in the [forks](https://github.com/jedda/Counterpart/network).
