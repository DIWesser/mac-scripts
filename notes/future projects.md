This document is a dumping ground for things I might make at some point.  

## Mac and Linux Backup Script

Added: 2018-01-07  

- [Counterpart](https://github.com/jedda/Counterpart)
  - This is a rsync 3 wrapper for OSX
  - There do seem to be some interesting tweaks in the [forks](https://github.com/jedda/Counterpart/network).

## VPN Manager

Added: 2018-03-06  

Make a simple script to allow consitant commands for different VPNs. This would make it possible to use all VPNs with `vpn [name] [action]`. For example `vpn dal connect`.
